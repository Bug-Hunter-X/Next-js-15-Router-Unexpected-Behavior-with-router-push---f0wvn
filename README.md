# Next.js 15 Router Issue

This repository demonstrates a strange routing issue encountered in Next.js 15 when using `router.push()` to navigate between pages.  Sometimes, the navigation doesn't work as expected, leading to blank pages or incorrect routes.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Click the button to return to the home page.

In some instances, the navigation will fail, and you might end up with a blank page, an error, or an incorrect route.

## Potential Causes (Speculation)

* **Asynchronous Operations:** The issue might be related to asynchronous operations interfering with the router's behavior.  It's possible that the `router.push()` call is not waiting for previous async operations to complete.
* **Incorrect usage of `router.push()`:** There might be edge cases or specific situations where `router.push()` behaves unexpectedly.
* **Next.js 15 Bug:** It's possible this is a bug in Next.js 15 itself.
